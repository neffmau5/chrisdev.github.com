:summary: Covers the agend of the workshop.



 

The Trinidad and Tobago DevOps workshop is a workshop designed to help participants further their web development prowess
through the use of various modern development technologies. In the workshop. participants will work with technologies such 
as VirtualBox, Ansiable and Vagrant. Vagrant is an application that allows one to create a pre-specified development environment
on a local machine. This allows developers to avoid discrepancies between their machine and the machine the application will 
run on when completed. VirtualBox is an application used to allow for the setup and use of "Guest" operating systems as an application 
on your machine without the need for partitioning etc. Ansiable is a powerful application used to automate the configuration of the 
development environments created by using Vagrant and Virtual Box.
